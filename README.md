# It's a completed test assignment on Hackathon INT20h 2019
Once you are on our web site, there are a lot of photos from INT20h Hackathon album, <br />
which were grabbed from Flickr using Flickr API. <br />
Also Face++ API is connected to those photos. It helps to detect emotions on them. <br />
At the top of our site you can see 9 buttons. They are responsible for filtering emotions, grabbed from photos. <br />
Each button stands for particular emotion. <br />
Whole project was uploaded on Heroku cloud platform, so everyone can see it.
